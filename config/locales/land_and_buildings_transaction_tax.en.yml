    subtitle: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is a charge on land transactions in Scotland. Land transactions must be notified to Revenue Scotland unless the chargeable consideration is less than £40,000 or the transaction is otherwise exempt. For example, transactions in connection with a court order relating to divorce or dissolution of civil partnership. An Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS), may be due on the purchase of an additional property. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to complete and submit an accurate LBTT return, where required, and pay any tax due.

    how_calculated_ftb: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is paid at different rates on residential property transactions and is dependent on the chargeable consideration (usually the purchase price) of your home. You don’t pay tax on the full amount, only the amount that falls into a certain band.
    how_calculated_ftb_2: For example, a home costing £280,000 would be charged no LBTT on the first £145,000, 2% on the next £105,000, and 5% on the next £30,000, so you’d pay £3,600 in LBTT.

    how_calculated: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is a progressive tax that is applied to residential land and buildings transactions where a chargeable interest is acquired. It is a charge that is more proportionate to the actual price of the property. The percentage rate for each band is applied only to the part of the price over the relevant threshold and up to the next threshold. For example, someone buying a property for £280,000 would pay no tax on the value of the property up to £145,000, 2% tax on the property value between £145,001 and £250,000 and 5% on the property value between £250,001 and £280,000. In this case, total liability for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) would be £3,600 giving an effective tax rate of 1.29% (average percentage rate of tax paid).
    how_calculated_additional: "Anyone buying a second home in Scotland may be liable for an additional dwelling supplement (ADS) on purchases of additional residential properties in Scotland of £40,000 or more. The current rate is %{additional_property_rate}% of the total chargeable consideration (usually the property price) for an additional residential property of £40,000 or more. For example, for a £200,000 second home the ADS would be £8,000. The ADS is payable in addition to the LBTT that would be due on the purchase. The rates and bands for LBTT are set out below:"
