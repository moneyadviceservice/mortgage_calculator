    subtitle: "Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) has replaced Stamp Duty in Scotland. If you’re buying a residential property over £145,000, you’ll have to pay LBTT. This calculator works out how much Land and Buildings Transaction Tax you need to pay on your new home.

      It also works out how much you’ll pay on any additional property purchase over £40,000, like a buy to let or second home, which attracts an extra %{additional_property_rate}% Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS)."

    how_calculated_toggle: "How is this calculated?"
    how_calculated_ftb: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is paid at different rates on residential property transactions and is dependent on the chargeable consideration (usually the purchase price) of your home. You don’t pay tax on the full amount, only the amount that falls into a certain band.
    how_calculated_ftb_2: For example, a home costing £280,000 would be charged no LBTT on the first £145,000, 2% on the next £105,000, and 5% on the next £30,000, so you’d pay £3,600 in LBTT. 
    how_calculated_ftb_3_html: First-time buyers can claim First-time Buyer relief. <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/first-time-buyer-money-tips" target="_blank">You can find out more about what a first-time buyer is on our website.</a> Depending on the purchase price, this relief can reduce your LBTT bill by up to £600.
    how_calculated_ftb_4: "It means that homes with purchase prices up to %{amount} are effectively free from LBTT for first-time buyers."
    how_calculated_ftb_5: "For example:"
    how_calculated: "Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is paid at different rates, depending on the band the purchase price falls into. For example, someone buying a property for £280,000 would pay no tax on the value of the property up to £145,000, 2% tax on the property value between £145,001 and £250,000 and 5% on the property value between £250,001 and £280,000. In this case, total liability for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) would be £3,600 giving an effective tax rate of 1.29% (average percentage rate of tax paid)."
    how_calculated_additional: "Anyone buying a second home including a buy to let property will pay an extra %{additional_property_rate}% on top of the relevant standard rate band. In this example that would represent an extra £11,200, meaning the total stamp duty would be £14,800 giving an effective tax rate of 5.29%."
    how_calculated_extra: "* Properties under %{amount} are not subject to second home Additional Dwelling Supplement"
