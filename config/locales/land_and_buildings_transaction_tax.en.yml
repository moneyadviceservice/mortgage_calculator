      - Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is a charge on land transactions in Scotland. Land transactions must be notified to Revenue Scotland unless the chargeable consideration is less than £40,000 or the transaction is otherwise exempt. For example, transactions in connection with a court order relating to divorce or dissolution of civil partnership. An Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS), may be due on the purchase of an additional property. It is the responsibility of the taxpayer to complete and submit an accurate LBTT return, where required, and pay any tax due.

      tooltip_html: An additional dwelling supplement (ADS) of LBTT may be applied on purchases of additional residential properties in Scotland of £40,000 or more. The current rate for ADS is %{additional_property_rate}% of the ‘relevant consideration’ (usually the purchase price).

    how_calculated_toggle: "How is this calculated?"
    how_calculated_ftb: Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is paid at different rates on residential property transactions and is dependent on the chargeable consideration (usually the purchase price) of your home. You don’t pay tax on the full amount, only the amount that falls into a certain band.
    how_calculated_ftb_2: For example, a home costing £280,000 would be charged no LBTT on the first £145,000, 2% on the next £105,000, and 5% on the next £30,000, so you’d pay £3,600 in LBTT.
