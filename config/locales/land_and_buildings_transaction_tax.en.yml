    how_calculated_toggle: "How is this calculated?"
    how_calculated: "Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) is paid at different rates, depending on the band the purchase price falls into. For example, someone buying a property for £280,000 would pay no tax on the value of the property up to £145,000, 2% tax on the property value between £145,001 and £250,000 and 5% on the property value between £250,001 and £280,000. In this case, total liability for Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) would be £3,600 giving an effective tax rate of 1.29% (average percentage rate of tax paid)."
    how_calculated_additional: "Anyone buying a second home including a buy to let property will pay an extra 3% on top of the relevant standard rate band. In this example that would represent an extra £8,400, meaning the total stamp duty would be £12,000 giving an effective tax rate of 4.29%."
    how_calculated_extra: "* Properties under %{amount} are not subject to second home Additional Dwelling Supplement"
