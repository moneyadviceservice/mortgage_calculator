    subtitle: "Calculate the Stamp Duty on your residential property in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. You have to pay Stamp Duty (SDLT) if you buy a property costing more than £125,000. Use this calculator to work out how much Stamp Duty is payable."

    legislation_change: "Before 4 December 2014, you paid Stamp Duty at a single rate on the whole purchase price. If you exchanged contracts by midnight on 3 December and the transaction completes on 4 December or later, you can choose whether you pay Stamp Duty at the old or new rates."

    how_calculated: "Stamp Duty is paid at different rates, depending on the purchase price. For example, someone buying a property for £245,000 would pay no tax on the value of the property up to £125,000 and 2% tax on the property value between £125,001 and £245,000. In this case, total liability for Stamp Duty would be £2,400. In addition, from April 2016 landlords and anyone buying an additional home will pay an extra 3% charge, in this case £6000."
    how_calculated_extra: "* The stamp duty calculator does not take into account the additional 3% charge for Buy To Let or secondary home purchases."
