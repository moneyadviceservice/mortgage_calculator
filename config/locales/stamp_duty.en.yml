      <p>First time buyers paying between £300,000 and £500,000 will pay SDLT at 5% on the amount of the purchase price in excess of £300,000. First time buyers purchasing property for more than £500,000 will not be entitled to any relief and will pay SDLT at the normal rates.</p>
      <p>A first-time buyer is defined as an individual or individuals who have never owned an interest in a residential property in the United Kingdom or anywhere else in the world and who intends to occupy the property as their main residence. This includes acquisitions by inheritance or gift.</p>
      <p>First time buyers purchasing property for more than £500,000 will not be entitled to any relief and will pay SDLT at the normal rates. The relief must be claimed in an SDLT return.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>it will not be the only residential property worth £40,000 or more that you own (or part own) anywhere in the world</li>

        <li>no one else has a lease on it which has more than 21 years left to run</li>

      <p>You may have to pay the higher rates even if you intend to live in the property you’re buying (and regardless of whether or not you already own a residential property).</p>
      <p>This is because the rules do not apply only to you (the buyer), but also to anyone you’re married to or buying with.</p>
