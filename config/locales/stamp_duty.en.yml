    title: Calculate the Stamp Duty on your residential property
    subtitle: "Calculate the Stamp Duty on your residential property in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. You have to pay Stamp Duty (SDLT) if you buy a property costing more than £125,000 (£40,000 for additional homes). Use this calculator to work out how much Stamp Duty is payable."
    subtitle_legislation_change: "From the 1st April 2016 anyone purchasing an additional home including buy to let properties will have to pay an extra 3% surcharge on top of each stamp duty band."
    second_subtitle: "Land and Buildings Transaction Tax (LBTT) has replaced Stamp Duty in Scotland. LBTT rates will also attract a 3% surcharge for second homes from 1st April 2016."

    legislation_change: "Before 4 December 2014, you paid Stamp Duty at a single rate on the whole purchase price. If you exchanged contracts by midnight on 3 December and the transaction completes on 4 December or later, you can choose whether you pay Stamp Duty at the old or new rates."

    how_calculated: "Stamp Duty is paid at different rates, depending on the purchase price. For example, someone buying a property for £245,000 would pay no tax on the value of the property up to £125,000 and 2% tax on the property value between £125,001 and £245,000. In this case, total liability for Stamp Duty would be £2,400 giving an effective tax rate of 1%."
    how_calculated_additional: "As of April 2016, anyone buying a second home including a buy to let property will pay an extra 3% on top of the relevant standard rate band. In this example that would represent an extra £7,350, meaning the total stamp duty would be £9,750 giving an effective tax rate of 4%."
    how_calculated_extra: "* Properties under £40,000 are not subject to second home SDLT"
