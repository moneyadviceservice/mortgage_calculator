    subtitle_paras: 
      - Until 1 April 2021, you will pay no Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) on the purchase of your main property costing up to £500,000. If the completion date of your house purchase is on or after this date we recommend you use this <a href="https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/calculate-stamp-duty-land-tax/#/intro" target="_blank">calculator</a> to calculate any liability to stamp duty on your property purchase.
      - You pay a different tax if your property or land is in <a href="/en/tools/house-buying/land-and-buildings-transaction-tax-calculator-scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> or <a href="/en/tools/house-buying/land-transaction-tax-calculator-wales" target="_blank">Wales</a>.  Anyone buying an additional residential property worth £40,000 or more will still have to pay an additional rate of stamp duty even if the property you already own is abroad. You are responsible for ensuring an SDLT return is sent to HMRC and pay any tax due within 14 days of the transaction date (usually the date of completion).

      tooltip_html: You must pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland. There are different rules if you’re buying an additional property. <br /><br />You must generally pay the higher SDLT rates when you buy a residential property or a part of one if it will not be the only residential property that you own (or part own) anywhere in the world, you have not sold or given away your previous main home and no one else has a lease on it which has more than 21 years left to run. These rules apply if you’re married to or buying with someone.

    how_calculated: "Stamp Duty is paid at different rates, depending on the purchase price. For example, someone subject to Stamp Duty buying a property for £550,000 would pay no tax on the value of the property up to £500,000 and 5% tax on the property value between £500,001 and £550,000. In this case, total liability for Stamp Duty would be £2,500 giving an effective tax rate of 0.45%.

    how_calculated_additional: "Those subject to the additional rates of stamp duty rates will pay an extra 3% on top of the relevant standard rate band. In this example that would represent an extra £16,500, meaning the total stamp duty would be £19,000 giving an effective tax rate of 3.45%."
