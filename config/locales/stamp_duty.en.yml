    subtitle_paras:
      - You must pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland. This calculator will help you work out how much you have to pay if you are buying residential property.
      - If you are buying non-residential property or land, or if any of the purchasers are non-UK resident&#42; this calculator can’t help. Instead go to <a href='https://www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax'>www.gov.uk/stamp-duty-land-tax</a>.
      - "&#42; You are treated as non-UK resident for Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you are not present in the UK for 183 days or more in the 12 months before the effective date of the purchase."

      tooltip_html: You must pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland. There are different rules if you’re buying an additional property. <br /><br />You must generally pay the higher SDLT rates when you buy a residential property or a part of one if it will not be the only residential property that you own (or part own) anywhere in the world, you have not sold or given away your previous main home and no one else has a lease on it which has more than 21 years left to run. These rules apply if you’re married to or buying with someone.
