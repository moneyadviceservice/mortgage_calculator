    title: Calculate the Stamp Duty on your residential property purchase in England or Northern Ireland
    subtitle: SYou must pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you buy a property over the current SDLT threshold of £125,000. You pay a different tax if your property or land is in <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/house-buying/land-and-buildings-transaction-tax-calculator-scotland" target="_blank">Scotland</a> or <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/tools/house-buying/land-transaction-tax-calculator-wales" target="_blank">Wales</a>. There are different rules if you or the person you’re buying with are first time buyers purchasing their first home and the purchase price is less than £500,000. Anyone buying an additional residential property worth £40,000 or more will have to pay additional stamp duty even if the property you already own is abroad. You must send an SDLT return to HMRC and pay the tax within 14 days.

      tooltip_html: You must pay Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland. There are different rules if you’re buying your first home or an additional residential property. <br /><br />There are different rules if you’re buying your first home. You get a discount (relief) that means you pay less or no tax. A first-time buyer is an individual who has never acquired a major interest in a property either in the UK or anywhere else in the world and intends to live in the property as their only or main residence. <a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk/en/articles/first-time-buyer-money-tips" target="_blank">Read more in our First-time buyer guide</a>. <br /><br />You must generally pay the higher SDLT rates when you buy a residential property or a part of one if it will not be the only residential property that you own (or part own) anywhere in the world, you have not sold or given away your previous main home and no one else has a lease on it which has more than 21 years left to run. These rules apply if you’re married to or buying with someone.
