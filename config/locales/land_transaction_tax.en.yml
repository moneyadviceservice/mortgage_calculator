Higher residential rates may apply if you already own one or more residential properties. However, if you are replacing your main residence the higher rates may not apply.  You must send an LTT return to Welsh Revenue Authority and pay the tax within 30 days of the day after completion (or other effective date of the transaction)."

    how_calculated: "Land Transaction Tax (LTT) is paid at both main and higher rates of tax.  This is usually based on the price you pay for the property or land, but it might include other types of payment such as goods, works or services, release from a debt, or transfer of a debt, including the value of any outstanding mortgage. For example, someone buying a property for £280,000 would pay no tax on the value of the property up to £180,000, 3.5% tax on the property value between £180,001 and £250,000 and 5% on the property value between £250,001 and £280,000. In this case, total liability for Land Transaction Tax (LTT) would be £3,950 giving an effective tax rate of 1.41% (average percentage rate of tax paid)."

    how_calculated_additional: "Anyone buying additional property may have to pay a higher rate of LTT. In this example that would represent an extra £8,400, meaning the total Land Transaction Tax would be £12,350 giving an effective tax rate of 4.41%. If you are replacing your main residence the higher rates may not apply.
